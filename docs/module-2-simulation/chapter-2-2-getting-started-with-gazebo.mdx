# Chapter 2.2: Getting Started with Gazebo

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Gazebo simulation environment
- Understand SDF (Simulation Description Format) for world definition
- Spawn robots and objects in simulation environments
- Navigate the Gazebo GUI and visualization tools

## Installing and Configuring Gazebo

Gazebo provides a comprehensive 3D simulation environment for robotics development. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and ROS version.

### System Requirements
- **Ubuntu 20.04/22.04**: Recommended for compatibility with ROS 2 Humble
- **64-bit processor** with SSE2 support
- **8GB+ RAM** for complex simulations
- **Dedicated GPU** with OpenGL 3.3+ support
- **Multi-core processor** for parallel physics simulation

### Installation Methods

#### Ubuntu Installation
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gazebo
```

#### ROS 2 Integration
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-*
```

### Initial Configuration

After installation, verify Gazebo functionality:
```bash
gazebo --version
gazebo
```

## World Files and SDF (Simulation Description Format)

Simulation Description Format (SDF) is the XML-based language for describing simulation environments in Gazebo. SDF files define:

### World Structure
```xml
<sdf version='1.7'>
  <world name='my_world'>
    <!-- World elements go here -->
  </world>
</sdf>
```

### Key SDF Elements

#### Models
- Physical objects with geometry, mass, and material properties
- Can include URDF models for robots
- Support for sensors and actuators

#### Lighting
- Directional, point, and spot light sources
- Shadows and ambient lighting
- Time-of-day simulation

#### Physics Engine
- Selection of ODE, Bullet, or DART
- Gravity and numerical parameters
- Real-time update rates

#### Plugins
- Custom simulation logic
- Sensor interfaces
- ROS 2 communication bridges

## Spawning Robots and Objects

Gazebo provides multiple methods for adding objects to simulation environments:

### Command Line Spawning
```bash
gz model --spawn-file my_robot.sdf --model-name my_robot --z 1.0
```

### ROS 2 Integration
```bash
ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -file my_robot.urdf -entity my_robot
```

### Programmatic Spawning
Using the Gazebo API or ROS 2 services to dynamically add objects during simulation.

## The Gazebo GUI and Visualization Tools

The Gazebo graphical interface provides several key components:

### 3D Visualization Window
- Real-time rendering of the simulation environment
- Camera controls for different viewing angles
- Overlay displays for physics information

### Scene Tree
- Hierarchical view of all objects in the simulation
- Property inspection and modification
- Object selection and manipulation

### Time Control
- Play, pause, and reset simulation
- Real-time factor adjustment
- Step-by-step simulation for debugging

### Tools Panel
- Model insertion and manipulation
- Light editing
- Scene properties

## Practical Exercise

Create a simple world file with:
1. A ground plane with texture
2. A basic robot model
3. Several static objects
4. Directional lighting

Launch Gazebo with your world file and experiment with the GUI controls.

## Summary

Gazebo provides a powerful simulation environment for robotics development. Understanding its installation, configuration, and basic operation is essential for creating effective digital twins. The SDF format offers flexibility in defining complex simulation scenarios.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into physics configuration and tuning for realistic simulation behavior.
