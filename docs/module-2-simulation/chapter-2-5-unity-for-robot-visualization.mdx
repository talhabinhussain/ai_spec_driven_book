- **Unity Robotics Package**: Provides tools and examples for robotics workflows

### Setup Requirements
- **Unity 2021.3 LTS** or later recommended
- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** for compatibility
- **Unity-Robotics-Hub** package from Unity Package Manager
- **ROS-TCP-Connector** for communication bridge

### Installation Process
1. Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor
2. Import Unity Robotics Hub package
3. Set up ROS-TCP-Connector in Unity project
4. Configure ROS 2 workspace for communication

## Importing Robot Models into Unity
